GroupTagger for Android v0.1
----------------------------

GroupTagger is an application designed to allow you to categorize your music
by assigning lists of tags to each audio file. You can then use the Smart
Playlist functionality in your favorite audio player to search and organize
your music using these tags. 

A similar plugin for the Exaile Audio Player exists, and information can be
found on my blog at:
